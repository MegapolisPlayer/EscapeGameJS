# EscapeGameJS

a school project escape game

Actual name: Escape from the Olomouc Region

# NOTES
This is my first real attempt at doing anything in JS so the code is quite janky in places and the packaging system... let's say that a shell script which works only on Linux (and Mac maybe?) is suboptimal at best. It does work and doesn't use any deprecated or vendor-specific functions (so success, kinda) but there is heavy pollution of the global namespace. (random variables do in fact go brrr)

# Issues
If you encounter issues, please email them to megapolispl@outlook.com and I will try to get back to you.

Purple screen means loading, that is not an issue most of the time.
