			<li>Nezamyslice were originally going to be Němčice nad Hanou, a real village 6km away. It was decided to remake the location due to the real-life layout of railroad tracks.</li>
			<li>All cities are real and in the Olomouc Region in the Czech Republic.</li>
			<li>Studénka had 3 fatal railway accidents since 1990 - in 1990 a train hit a car and 1 person died, in 2008 a train hit a falling bridge (yes, really) killing 8 people and in 2015 a SC Pendolino train hit a truck killing 3 passengers.</li>
			<li>Přerov's criminal history is a bit of a Czech meme.</li>
			<li>With some exceptions (Nezamyslice house), all photos come from the location`s actual, real-life locations.</li>
			<li>This game was originally planned in Scratch, however due to technical difficulties we ended up switching to JS. Good riddance if you ask me.</li>
			<li>Out of all the school escape game projects, this one is the largest measuring in at >103 MB. It is also the only one fully playable on mobile, with a save system and the only one written in JS and published on GitHub.</li>

		<h>Rant about Scratch by Martin</h>
		<p>
            Don't get me wrong, Scratch is a wonderful way to teach children how to
			code. But for anything more complex than a spinning cat eating apples
			Scratch rapidly becomes a very slow and terrible experience. I will
			list my biggest gripes about Scratch:
        </p>
		<ol>
			<li>Size limit - 10MB for sound and 50MB total is just plain not enough
			for larger projects. (sure, compression exists but then the quality
			falls of a tall cliff)</li>
			<li>Lack of documentation - the Scratch wiki is horrendously outdated and
			usually doesn't have great explanations.</li>
			<li>Variables - local/global divide - you can't change or view the state of
			the variable (you kind of can view it but still)</li>
			<li>The cloning system - it's bad, nowhere does it denote whether it does or
			does not copy the local or global variables</li>
			<li>Quality, resolution - 480x360 is not really enough for most larger projects</li>
			<li>Flexibility - basically none, very few options for blocks</li>
			<li>Performance - what is optimization? Even for moderately complex projects the
			loading time is measured in minutes. (Even Python and JS (in which this is written))
			are good in comparison).</li>
			<li>Collaboration - you can't unless you spend hours setting up Studios.
				Git/GitHub is simpler. (except for submodules and GitHub Actions but who cares))</li>
			<li>Licensing - I do sometimes like sharing my projects under something different
			CC-BY-SA 2.0.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			In fairness though, Scratch is really a great tool for teaching young kids the basics of algorithms
			(if statements, for loops, cycles, variables...) and such but it just isn't designed for anything more complex.<br>
